The 2015 Happiness Report, also known as the World Happiness Report 2015, is a publication that presents rankings of countries based on their levels of happiness and well-being. The report is a collaborative effort between the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Earth Institute at Columbia University, with contributions from various researchers and experts.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","The report includes rankings of 158 countries based on the \"World Happiness Index,\" which is calculated using survey data from the Gallup World Poll and other sources. The index combines factors such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption to assess overall happiness levels.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","The 2015 Happiness Report sheds light on the relationship between happiness, well-being, and sustainable development, emphasizing the importance of incorporating measures of happiness into policy-making and development strategies. It provides valuable insights into global happiness levels, highlighting the factors that contribute to happiness and offering recommendations for policymakers and individuals to improve overall well-being.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n"," Everything you need is provided below.
