You'll apply what you've learned so far to clean, organize, and analyze the dataset, making decisions about how to handle various challenges along the way. This will involve extracting key information, performing calculations, and identifying patterns within the data.\n","\n","Throughout the lab, you'll be expected to make use of your problem-solving skills, as well as the tools and techniques introduced in previous lessons. We encourage you to keep your past notebooks and cheatsheets open as a reference to guide you through the process.
