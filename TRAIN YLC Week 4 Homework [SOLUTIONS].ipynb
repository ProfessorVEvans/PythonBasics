For example, the 2019-2020 NBA season would be represented as \"2000\".\n","\n","- `age`: The age of the player as of February 1 of that season.\n","\n","- `team_id`: The abbreviation for the team that the player played for during that season. Each NBA team has a unique abbreviation, like 'LAL' for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n","\n","- `G`: Games Played - The number of games the player participated in during that season.\n","\n","- `Min`: Minutes Played - The total number of minutes the player was on the court during the season.\n","\n","- `MPG`: Minutes Per Game - This is the average number of minutes the player was on the court per game during the season. It's calculated as Min divided by G.\n","\n","- `FT%`: Free Throw Percentage - This is the percentage of free throws the player made successfully. A free throw is an opportunity given to a player to score one point, unopposed, from a position 15 feet from the basket.
