It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset includes 569 instances, each with 30 numeric, real-valued features. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images, such as texture, radius, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.\n","\n","The target variable in this dataset is binary, indicating whether the breast mass is malignant or benign.
