This will involve applying what you already know about neural nets and new NLP concepts of tokenization and vectorization.\n","\n","For this project, we will be working with the `fetch_20newsgroups` dataset, which is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. Each newsgroup covers a different topic, such as sports, politics, religion, and technology. The documents within each newsgroup were posted by various authors, and cover a wide range of subtopics related to the main theme of the newsgroup.\n","\n","The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify newsgroup documents based on their content.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### **Lab Structure**\n","**Part 1**: [News Subject Classification with a DNN](#p1)\n","\n","**Part 2**: [News Subject Classification with a CNN](#p2)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### **Goals**\n","By the end of this lab, you will:\n","* Understand the concept of tokenization in NLP.\n","* Compare a fully connected network to a CNN for text classification.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### **Cheat Sheets**\n","[Natural Language Processing I](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZaLtMF7aQsG05myetJpoTJlr-sAIURP_a9sQr66pfqw/edit?usp=drive_link)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","**Before starting, run the code below to import all necessary functions and libraries.**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"mbZXQ3rA3NwL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install --quiet torch==1.13.1\n","!pip install --quiet torchdata==0.5.1\n","\n","!pip install torch\n","!pip install torchtext\n","import torchtext\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from keras.models import Sequential\n","from keras.layers import *\n","from keras.optimizers import Adam\n","from keras.utils import to_categorical\n","\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"],"metadata":{"id":"YAvvLhRIoqYp","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1704341005897,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":135978,"user":{"displayName":"Angelique Membrido","userId":"04984385250682432912"}},"outputId":"50e21fa5-9f16-4be4-852f-400af291905e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[33mWARNING: Ignoring invalid distribution -orch (/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages)\u001b[0m\u001b[33m\n","\u001b[0m\u001b[33mWARNING: Ignoring invalid distribution -orch (/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages)\u001b[0m\u001b[33m\n","\u001b[0m\u001b[31mERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.
