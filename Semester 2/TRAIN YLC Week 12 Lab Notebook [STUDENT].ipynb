Additionally, it explores data visualization using the matplotlib library. Finally, you will gain an exposure to different data wrangling commands. Throughout the notebook, you'll review how to load and manipulate datasets effectively with pandas commands and leverage matplotlib to create insightful visualizations that aid in uncovering patterns, trends, and insights within the data.\n","\n","\n","\n","### **Lab Structure**\n","**Part 1**: [Exploratory Data Analysis Review](#p1)\n","\n","  >  **Part 1.1**: [Basic Commands](#p1.1)\n","\n","  >  **Part 1.2**: [Further Exploration](#p1.2)\n","\n","**Part 2**: [Data Visualization Review](#p2)\n","\n","\n","**Part 3**: [Introduction to Data Wrangling](#p3)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### **Learning Objectives**\n","By the end of this lab, we will:\n","* Understand basic pandas commands for EDA.\n","\n","* Understand basic matplotlib commands for Data Visualization.\n","\n","* Recognize how to use basic data wrangling commands.\n","\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","### **Resources**\n","* [EDA with pandas Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xnKJsii1AsRH2t22XtrAh7FzSFGqAR0hAmW4oLYM4MI/edit?usp=drive_link)\n","\n","* [Data Visualization with matplotlib Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_3hzeIBPvcT6VC-eK-DDGVsKUvdVSvylNepoSLn2-T4/edit?usp=drive_link)\n","\n","* [Data Wrangling with pandas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zZ9ItNrI45AzFaDI21qDLS3Zd1JFZtSRIp8KlTeBIRE/edit?usp=sharing)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","**Before starting, run the code below to import all necessary functions and libraries.**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"nvymFWiixQvT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np"],"metadata":{"id":"9de72I1w8qKR"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<a name=\"p1\"></a>\n","\n","---\n","## **Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis Review**\n","---\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-l9pd5CCqVtD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<a name=\"p1.1\"></a>\n","\n","---\n","### **Part 1.1: Basic Commands**\n","---\n","\n","\n","**Run the code cell below to create the DataFrame.**"],"metadata":{"id":"T9LU--mDehnn"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df = pd.DataFrame({'U.S. State': ['California', 'Florida', 'Indiana', 'Texas', 'Pennsylvania'],\n","        'Population (in millions)': [38, 21, 6.5, 28, 13],\n","        'Capitol': ['Sacramento', 'Tallahassee', 'Indianapolis', 'Austin', 'Harrisburg'],\n","        'GDP ($ in billions)': [3700, 1070, 352, 1876, 726]})"],"metadata":{"id":"iD9_DTVCzRbY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### **Problem #1.1.1**\n","\n","**Together**, let's inspect what `.head()` tells us about this DataFrame."],"metadata":{"id":"hjbtt13XrE7G"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"_d_m_CVn0t-z"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### **Problem #1.1.2**\n","\n","**Together**, let's determine what datatype `Population (in millions)` is."],"metadata":{"id":"_xkLxO4drLIL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"sn1aSL4ceKOj"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### **Problem #1.1.3**\n","\n","**Together**, let's print all of the unique values for `GDP ($ in billions)`."],"metadata":{"id":"M2ZiYzdX06OR"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"NTMZN8Tw07bU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---\n","\n","#### **Now it's your turn!
